    "In this notebook, we estimate the statistical significance of our results.  \n",
    "Our null hypothesis (H₀) is that there is no difference in the distribution of sentiment protection between female and male authors:\n",
    "\n",
    "**H₀**: The presence of sentiment protection (coded as 0 or 1) is distributed evenly across women’s and men’s subcorpora.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Drawing on insights from feminist literary criticism, we propose that female authors may be more likely to demonstrate sentiment protection. Therefore, our alternative hypothesis (H₁) is:\n",
    "\n",
    "**H₁**: Sentiment protection (0 or 1) is present more frequently in the subcorpus of female authors than in that of male authors.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We will conduct standard p-value-based tests to evaluate the statistical significance of this hypothesis and then offer a critical reflection on why such tests may have limited interpretive value in this context.\n"

In this study, while gender is a fixed and meaningful category, the null hypothesis asserts that it has no statistical effect on sentiment. Therefore, under the null, the exchangeability assumption is justifiable. Nonetheless, it is important to recognize the interpretive weight of gender in literary contexts and to consider this when drawing conclusions from statistically randomized procedures.\n",

    "When interpreting the statistical data from the Mann-Whitney and permutation tests, we noticed that traditional tools for testing the statistical significance of hypotheses present some challenges in this case:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **High Variability in Small Datasets**\\\n",
    "Even within a single genre or gender group, and even across a basic variable like different sentiment metrics, sentiment scores exhibit very high variability. In small datasets (e.g., ours with N=116), this makes such tests more of an abstract calculation than a meaningful assessment of hypothesis significance. In effect, the hypothesis may only hold within the specific observed dataset and cannot be generalized.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Interpreting Sentiment Differences**\\\n",
    "For assessing differences in sentiment, a more appropriate statistical approach is needed—one that accurately captures deviations from the mean. Estimating a \"mean of means\" is generally considered poor practice; instead, the sentiment mean should be calculated directly by summing all sentiment scores for each evaluated chunk. However, in this type of analysis, we do not observe raw sentiment but rather a transformed or averaged value that reflects a new qualitative dimension. This metric can reflect whether the author is \"self-centered,\" expressing their thoughts directly and using characters as conduits, or whether they adopt a more \"emancipated\" approach by letting characters speak independently. The metric does not judge but simply operationalizes whether a writer isolates negative emotions in their own narration or distributes them among the characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Interpretation of P-Values**\\\n",
    "P-value interpretation also requires caution. We found that the T-test, Mann-Whitney, and permutation tests have limited power in establishing statistical significance given our data. Unsurprisingly, due to the significant coefficient of variation and the small sample size, the p-values for sentiment differences were 0.5775 (Mann-Whitney) and 0.295 (permutation test). The chi-squared test yielded a slightly better value of 0.1029. While this is closer to the conventional threshold, it’s important to remember that the commonly used cutoffs of 0.05 or 0.01 (often applied in fields like medicine) are conventions rather than absolute truths. A p-value of 0.1029 implies there is a 10.29% probability of observing a difference in sentiment protection between male and female authors as extreme (or more extreme) as the one observed, assuming no actual association (i.e., the null hypothesis is true).\n",
    "\n",
    "However, when working with literary texts—which inherently demonstrate individuality even in sentiment variations—should 10.29% be considered significantly worse than 5%? Perhaps not. In such cases, critical interpretation and domain expertise (even if it involves some degree of subjective or \"voluntaristic\" judgment) should complement, if not override, rigid statistical conventions that originate in other domains of human knowledge.1."
