    "# Notebook 2: Direct Speech Extraction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, direct speech was extracted. We used the basic assumption that in Japanese texts, direct speech is enclosed in quotation marks 「」. This corresponds with the standards of modern Japanese language. Other marks such as 『』 and 〈〉 are used for emphasis, proper names, or book titles, for example.\n",
    "\n",
    "For European languages, Byszuk et al. estimated rule-based direct speech extraction. For languages with clear typographic conventions, like English, the regex-based system achieved high precision and recall (around 0.98 and 0.99, respectively). We can expect robust results with Japanese, as its direct speech marking is well-conventionalized.\n"
